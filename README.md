# CookBook – Your Virtual Kitchen Assistant 

**CookBook** is a fully-featured frontend recipe application built with **React + Vite**.  
It simulates a real full-stack app using **LocalStorage** and a custom **Fake API layer**, allowing full **CRUD operations** on recipes, **user authentication**, **favorites**, **advanced filtering**, and a beautiful responsive UI — **all without a real backend**.

### Protected Routes (Require Authentication)

These pages are only accessible when logged in.  
Unauthenticated users will be redirected to `/login`.

| Route               | Description                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| `/add`              | Add a new recipe                |
| `/edit/:id`         | Edit an existing recipe         |
| `/my-cookbook`      | Your personal favorites         |
| `/my-recipes`       | Recipes created by you          |
| `/profile`          | View and edit your profile      |

Public routes (no login needed):
- `/` → Home
- `/recipes` → All recipes
- `/recipes/:id` → Recipe detail
- `/login`
- `/register`
### Fake Backend Keys in LocalStorage

All data is persistently stored in the browser's LocalStorage under these keys:
```text
cb_recipes    → All recipes (seeded + user-created)
cb_users      → Registered users (email + hashed password)
cb_user       → Currently logged-in user object
cb_favorites  → { "user@email.com": [1, 5, 23, ...] } – user's favorite recipe IDs
cb_seeded     → Boolean flag to prevent re-seeding sample data
```
